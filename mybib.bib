abstract = {E. J. Anderson and R. R. Weber, J. Appl. Probab., 28 (1990), pp. 839–851, considered the problem of two rendezvousers, R1,R2, randomly placed among n indistinguishable locations, who seek to meet in least expected time, using the same mixed strategy. We retain their dynamics but modify the rendezvousers' aim to meeting each other before either encounters an enemy searcher S. We solve this zero-sum game in minimal space (3 locations) and time (2 steps after placement), and find that optimal play requires that the rendezvous team use a mixture over behavioral strategies. While such complicated strategies are known to be necessary in principal for team games (the theory of Isbell and Alpern), we believe this is the first naturally occuring game where such a solution is derived. (An earlier paper by Lim solved a similar game in which R1 and R2 were allowed to use different strategies and joint randomization.)},

abstract = {Establishing communications in a dynamic spectrum access (DSA) network requires the communicating parties to “rendezvous” before transmitting their data packets. Frequency hopping (FH) is an effective rendezvous method that does not rely on a predetermined control channel. Recently, “quorum-based” FH approaches have been proposed for asynchronous rendezvous in DSA networks. These approaches are highly vulnerable to jamming, especially when the attacker is an insider node (i.e., a compromised node). In this paper, we investigate the problem of two secondary users (SUs), a transmitter and a receiver, try to rendezvous in the presence of a third SU acting as a jammer. The jammer is aware of the underlying (quorum-based) rendezvous design. First, we consider the case when all SUs are time-synchronized and are aware of the “rendezvous channel.” We formulate the problem as a three-player game between the transmitter, receiver, and jammer. The transmitter and receiver try to maximize the number of successful rendezvous slots, while minimizing the number of jammed rendezvous slots. The jammer has the opposite objective. We show that this game does not have a pure Nash equilibrium (NE). Accordingly, we formulate a simplified two-player game between the receiver and jammer (assuming a uniform strategy by the transmitter), and derive multiple pure NE strategies. Next, we study the case when the rendezvous channel is unknown and obtain the Bayesian NE. Finally, the asynchronous case is addressed by exploiting the “rotation closure property” of quorum systems. Our numerical experiments show that uncertainty about the transmitter's strategy improves the anti-jamming rendezvous performance. They also show that the rendezvous performance improves if the receiver and jammer are time-synchronized, and also improves if the receiver and jammer have a common guess about the transmitter's strategy.},

abstract = {We consider a new type of asymmetric rendezvous search problem in which Agent II needs to give Agent I a `gift' which can be in the form of information or material. The gift can either be transfered upon meeting, as in traditional rendezvous, or it can be dropped o? by II at a location he passes, in the hope it will be found by I. The gift might be a water bottle for a traveller lost in the desert; a supply cache for Lieutenant Scott in the Antarctic; or important information (left as a gift). The common aim of the two agents is to minimize the time taken for I to either meet II or find the gift. We find optimal agent paths and droppo? times when the search region is a line, the initial distance between the players is known and one or both of the players can leave gifts. When there are no gifts this is the classical asymmetric rendezvous problem solved by Alpern and Gal in 1995 [10]. We exhibit strategies solving these various problems and use a `rendezvous algorithm' to establish their optimality.},

We also give a complete solution to the periodic patrolling game on line graphs of arbitrary size, extending the work of Papadaki et al. (2016) to the periodic domain. This models the patrolling problem on a border or channel, which is related to a classical problem of operational research going back to Morse and Kimball (1951).

Encodings provided by these lattice games can be made particularly efficient for octal games, which we generalize to squarefree games. These encompass all heap games in a natural setting where the Sprague-Grundy theorem for normal play manifests itself geometrically. We provide an algorithm to compute normal play strategies. The setting of lattice games naturally allows for mis{\`{e}}re play, where 0 is declared a losing position. Lattice games also allow situations where larger finite sets of positions are declared losing. Generating functions for sets of winning positions provide data structures for strategies of lattice games. We conjecture that every lattice game has a rational strategy: a rational generating function for its winning positions. Additionally, we conjecture that every lattice game has an affine stratification: a partition of its set of winning positions into a finite disjoint union of finitely generated modules for affine semigroups. This conjecture is true for normal-play squarefree games and every lattice game with finite mis{\`{e}}re quotient. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Search games for a mobile or immobile hider traditionally have the hider permanently confined to a compact ‘search region' making eventual capture inevitable. Hence the payoff can be taken as time until capture. However in many real life search problems it is possible for the hider to escape an area in which he was known to be located (e.g. Bin Laden from Tora Bora) or for a prey animal to escape a predator's hunting territory. We model and solve such continuous time problems with escape where we take the probability of capture to be the searcher's payoff. We assume the searcher, while cruise searching, can cover the search region at unit rate of area, for a given time horizon T known to the hider. The hider can stay still or choose any time to flee the region. To counter this, the searcher can also adopt an ambush mode which will capture a fleeing hider. The searcher wins the game if he either finds the hider while cruise searching or ambushes him while he is attempting to flee; the hider wins if he flees successfully (while the searcher is cruising) or has not been found by time T. The optimal searcher strategy involves decreasing the ambush probability over time, to a limit of zero. This surprising behaviour is opposite to that found recently by Alpern et al. (2011, 2013) in a predator-prey game with similar dynamics but without the possibility of the hider escaping. Our work also complements that of Zoroa et al. (2015) on searching for multiple prey and Gal and Casas (2014) for a combined model of search and pursuit.},

abstract = {We advance and apply the mathematical theory of search games to model the problem faced by a predator searching for prey. Two search modes are available: ambush and cruising search. Some species can adopt either mode, with their choice at a given time traditionally explained in terms of varying habitat and physiological conditions. We present an additional explanation of the observed predator alternation between these search modes, which is based on the dynamical nature of the search game they are playing: the possibility of ambush decreases the propensity of the prey to frequently change locations and thereby renders it more susceptible to the systematic cruising search portion of the strategy. This heuristic explanation is supported by showing that in a new idealized search game where the predator is allowed to ambush or search at any time, and the prey can change locations at intermittent times, optimal predator play requires an alternation (or mixture) over time of ambush and cruise search. Thus, our game is an extension of the well-studied 'Princess and Monster' search game. Search games are zero sum games, where the pay-off is the capture time and neither the Searcher nor the Hider knows the location of the other. We are able to determine the optimal mixture of the search modes when the predator uses a mixture which is constant over time, and also to determine how the mode mixture changes over time when dynamic strategies are allowed (the ambush probability increases over time). In particular, we establish the 'square root law of search predation': the optimal proportion of active search equals the square root of the fraction of the region that has not yet been explored.},

abstract = {In adversarial multiagent domains, security, commonly defined as the ability to deal with intentional threats from other agents, is a critical issue. This paper focuses on domains where these threats come from unknown adversaries. These domains can be modeled as Bayesian games; much work has been done on finding equilibria for such games. However, it is often the case in multiagent security domains that one agent can commit to a mixed strategy which its adversaries observe before choosing their own strategies. In this case, the agent can maximize reward by finding an optimal strategy, without requiring equilibrium. Previous work has shown this problem of optimal strategy selection to be NP-hard. Therefore, we present a heuristic called ASAP, with three key advantages to address the problem. First, ASAP searches for the highest-reward strategy, rather than a Bayes-Nash equilibrium, allowing it to find feasible strategies that exploit the natural first-mover advantage of the game. Second, it provides strategies which are simple to understand, represent, and implement. Third, it operates directly on the compact, Bayesian game representation, without requiring conversion to normal form. We provide an efficient Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) implementation for ASAP, along with experimental results illustrating significant speedups and higher rewards over other approaches.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen considerable theoretical and applied research on Markov decision processes, as well as the growing use of these models in ecology, economics, communications engineering, and other fields where outcomes are uncertain and sequential decision-making processes are needed. A timely response to this increased activity, Martin L. Puterman's new work provides a uniquely up-to-date, unified, and rigorous treatment of the theoretical, computational, and applied research on Markov decision process models. It discusses all major research directions in the field, highlights many significant applications of Markov decision processes models, and explores numerous important topics that have previously been neglected or given cursory coverage in the literature. Markov Decision Processes focuses primarily on infinite horizon discrete time models and models with discrete time spaces while also examining models with arbitrary state spaces, finite horizon models, and continuous-time discrete state models. The book is organized around optimality criteria, using a common framework centered on the optimality (Bellman) equation for presenting results. The results are presented in a "theorem-proof" format and elaborated on through both discussion and examples, including results that are not available in any other book. A two-state Markov decision process model, presented in Chapter 3, is analyzed repeatedly throughout the book and demonstrates many results and algorithms. Markov Decision Processes covers recent research advances in such areas as countable state space models with average reward criterion, constrained models, and models with risk sensitive optimality criteria. It also explores several topics that have received little or no attention in other books, including modified policy iteration, multichain models with average reward criterion, and sensitive optimality. In addition, a Bibliographic Remarks section in each chapter comments on relevant historic},

abstract = {In this chapter we explore a wide range of judgment and decision tasks in which people are called on to allocate a scarce resource (e.g., money, choices, belief) over a fixed set of possibilities (e.g., investment opportunities, consumption options, events). We observe that in these situations people tend to invoke maximum entropy heuristics in which they are biased toward even allocation. Moreover, we argue that before applying these heuristics, decision makers subjectively partition the set of options into groups over which they apply even allocation. As a result, alloca-tions vary systematically with the particular partition that people happen to invoke, a phenomenon called partition dependence. We review evidence for maximum entropy heuristics and partition dependence in the following domains: (1) decision analysis in which degree of belief and importance weights must be distributed among possible events and attributes, respectively; (2) managerial decision making in which money and other organizational resources are allocated among risky pro-jects, divisions, and organizational stakeholders; and (3) consumer choice in which individuals make selections among various consumption goods and consumption time periods.},

abstract = {In order to be able to devise successful strategies for destabilizing covert organizations it is vital to recognize and understand their structural properties. Every covert organization faces the constant dilemma of staying secret and ensuring the necessary coordination between its members. Using elements from multi-objective optimization and bargaining game theory we analyze which communication structures are optimal in the sense of providing a balanced tradeoff between secrecy and operational efficiency. For several different secrecy and information scenarios this tradeoff is analyzed considering the set of connected graphs of given order as possible communication structures. Assuming uniform exposure probability of individuals in the network we show that the optimal communication structure corresponds to either a network with a central individual (the star graph) or an all-to-all network (the complete graph) depending on the link detection probability, which is the probability that communication between individuals will be detected. If the probability that an individual is exposed as member of the network depends on the information hierarchy determined by the structure of the graph, the optimal communication structure corresponds to a reinforced ring or wheel graph in case of an information measure based on average performance. In worst case performance with respect to information it can be seen that windmill wing graphs approximate optimal structures. Finally we give an example how optimal structures change when considering a non-balanced tradeoff between secrecy and operational efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It is assumed that Sethi's concave thief, i.e., a risk-averter, plays against the police, whose objective function incorporates convex costs of law enforcement, a one-shot utility at the time of arrest and a continuous utility or cost rate after the thief is arrested. The probability that the thief is caught by time t is influenced not only by the pilfering rate (as is the case in Sethi's model) but also by the instrumental variable of the police, namely its rate of law enforcement.

abstract = {When securing complex infrastructures or large environments, constant surveillance of every area is not affordable. To cope with this issue, a common countermeasure is the usage of cheap but wide-ranged sensors, able to detect suspicious events that occur in large areas, supporting patrollers to improve the effectiveness of their strategies. However, such sensors are commonly affected by uncertainty. In the present paper, we focus on spatially uncertain alarm signals. That is, the alarm system is able to detect an attack but it is uncertain on the exact position where the attack is taking place. This is common when the area to be secured is wide, such as in border patrolling and fair site surveillance. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first Patrolling Security Game where a Defender is supported by a spatially uncertain alarm system, which non-deterministically generates signals once a target is under attack. We show that finding the optimal strategy is FNP-hard even in tree graphs and APX-hard in arbitrary graphs. We provide two (exponential time) exact algorithms and two (polynomial time) approximation algorithms. Finally, we show that, without false positives and missed detections, the best patrolling strategy reduces to stay in a place, wait for a signal, and respond to it at best. This strategy is optimal even with non-negligible missed detection rates, which, unfortunately, affect every commercial alarm system. We evaluate our methods in simulation, assessing both quantitative and qualitative aspects.},

abstract = {Consider a patrol problem, where a patroller traverses a graph through edges to detect potential attacks at nodes. An attack takes a random amount of time to complete. The patroller takes one time unit to move to and inspect an adjacent node, and will detect an ongoing attack with some probability. If an attack completes before it is detected, a cost is incurred. The attack time distribution, the cost due to a successful attack, and the detection probability all depend on the attack node. The patroller seeks a patrol policy that minimizes the expected cost incurred when, and if, an attack eventually happens. We consider two cases. A random attacker chooses where to attack according to predetermined probabilities, while a strategic attacker chooses where to attack to incur the maximal expected cost. In each case, computing the optimal solution, although possible, quickly becomes intractable for problems of practical sizes. Our main contribution is to develop efficient index policies—based on Lagrangian relaxation methodology, and also on approximate dynamic programming—which typically achieve within 1{\%} of optimality with computation time orders of magnitude less than what is required to compute the optimal policy for problems of practical sizes},

abstract = {In this paper we consider a game theory approach for representing a real-world attacker-defender Stackelberg security game. In this novel approach the behavior of an ergodic system (repeated stochastic Markov chain game) is represented by a Lyapunov-like function non-decreasing in time. Then, the representation of the Stackelberg security game is transformed in a potential game in terms of Lyapunov. We present a method for constructing a Lyapunov-like function: the function replaces the recursive mechanism with the elements of the ergodic system seeking to drive the underlying finite-state Stackelberg game to an equilibrium point along a least expected cost path. The proposed method analyzes both pure and mixed stationary strategies to find the strong Stackelberg equilibrium. Mixed strategies are found when the resources available for both the defender and the attacker are limited. Lyapunov games model how players are likely to behave in one-shot games and allow finishing during the game whether the applied best-reply strategy (pure or mixed) provides the convergence to a shortest-path equilibrium point (or not). We prove that Lyapunov games truly fit into the framework for deterministic and stochastic shortest-path security games. The convergence rate of the proposed method to a Stackelberg/Nash equilibrium is analyzed. Validity of the proposed method is successfully demonstrated both theoretically and by a simulated experiment.},

abstract = {Security games are gaining significant interest in artificial intelligence. They are characterized by two players (a defender and an attacker) and by a set of targets the defender tries to protect from the attacker's intrusions by committing to a strategy. To reach their goals, players use resources such as patrollers and intruders. Security games are Stackelberg games where the appropriate solution concept is the leader-follower equilibrium. Current algorithms for solving these games are applicable when the underlying game is in normal form (i.e., each player has a single decision node). In this paper, we define and study security games with an extensive-form infinite-horizon underlying game, where decision nodes are potentially infinite. We introduce a novel scenario where the attacker can undertake actions during the execution of the defender's strategy. We call this new game class patrolling security games (PSGs), since its most prominent application is patrolling environments against intruders. We show that PSGs cannot be reduced to security games studied so far and we highlight their generality in tackling adversarial patrolling on arbitrary graphs. We then design algorithms to solve large instances with single patroller and single intruder. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Infrastructure security against possible attacks involves making decisions under uncertainty. This paper presents game theoretic models of the interaction between an adversary and a first responder in order to study the problem of security within a transportation infrastructure. The risk measure used is based on the consequence of an attack in terms of the number of people affected or the occupancy level of a critical infrastructure, e.g. stations, trains, subway cars, escalators, bridges, etc. The objective of the adversary is to inflict the maximum damage to a transportation network by selecting a set of nodes to attack, while the first responder (emergency management center) allocates resources (emergency personnel or personnel-hours) to the sites of interest in an attempt to find the hidden adversary. This paper considers both static and dynamic, in which the first responder is mobile, games. The unique equilibrium strategy pair is given in closed form for the simple static game. For the dynamic game, the equilibrium for the first responder becomes the best patrol policy within the infrastructure. This model uses partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) in which the payoff functions depend on an exogenous people flow, and thus, are time varying. A numerical example illustrating the algorithm is presented to evaluate an equilibrium strategy pair. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, these models are not directly applicable to the state highway patrol counterparts. Although urban police and the state highway patrol are both law enforcement agencies, an urban police force typically operates by reacting to crimes already committed (i.e., a reactive mode of operation) while the state highway patrol attempts to maintain a visible presence to prevent infractions (i.e., a proactive mode of operation). This paper describes a modeling approach that can be used to deploy state highway patrol cars to the road segments comprising a highway patrol district. Specifically, an integer nonlinear goal programming model is described and demonstrated within the context of a hypothetical case example. The model reflects the fact that the relationships between unit deployment and performance measures are often nonlinear?as additional patrol units are assigned to a road segment, performance will increase but at a decreasing rate. The model's goal constraints reflect the proactive nature of patrol deployment. The model is solved using a modified multi-criteria pattern/gradient search technique, and the results are analyzed to test their sensitivity to goal levels and priority structures.},

This capability is critical because the model's input parameters include (1) crime weights, which in general will have a subjective component, (2) crime descriptive data, which are difficult to estimate, and (3) crime frequency data, which are likely to change with time. The paper presents an illustrative application of the algorithm.

Nearly all of the programs calculated queuing statistics for the collection of patrol cars by assuming a steady-state system with calls for service arriving within priority levels according to Poisson processes and having independent, identical, exponentially distributed service times. Unavailabilities of patrol cars for reasons other than calls for service were handled in the models either by artificially increasing the arrival rate of calls or by assuming that the number of servers is smaller than the number of patrol cars. Some programs calculated additional performance measures such as travel times and preventive patrol frequencies. All the programs had the capabilities to describe performance statistics for an allocation proposed by the user, but they differed in their capabilities to prescribe desirable allocations. None of the programs had achieved general acceptance because each had virtues and inadequacies not present in the others. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Steve Alpern's original formulation of the rendezvous search problem in 1976 and his formalization of the continuous version (Alpern, 1995) have led to much research in rendezvous theory in the past few years. New material is covered in both Search Games (Book I) and Rendezvous Theory (Book II). The book examines a whole variety of new configurations of theory and problems that arise from these two aspects of the analysis - resulting in a penetrating state-of-the-art treatment of this highly useful mathematical, analytical tool.},

abstract = {In an accumulation game, a HIDER attempts to accumulate a certain number of objects or a certain quantity of material before a certain time, and a SEEKER attempts to prevent this. In a continuous accumulation game the HIDER can pile material either at locations 1. 2,..., n, or over a region in space. The HIDER will win (payoff 1) it if accumulates N units of material before a given time, and the goal of the SEEKER will win (payoff 0) otherwise, we assume the HIDER can place continuous material such as fuel at discrete locations i = 1. 2,.... n, and the game is played in discrete time. At each time k {\textgreater} 0 the HIDER acquires h units of material and can distribute it among all of the locations. At the same time, k, the SEEKER can search a certain number s {\textless} n of the locations, and will confiscate (or destroy) all material found. After explicitly describing what we mean by a continuous accumulation game oil discrete locations, we prove a theorem that gives a condition under which the HIDER can always win by using a uniform distribution at each stage of the game. When this condition does not hold, special cases and examples show that the resulting game becomes complicated even when played only for a single stage. We reduce the single stage game to an optimization problem. and also obtain some partial results on its solution. We also consider accumulation games where the locations are arranged in either a circle or in a line segment and the SEEKER must search a series of adjacent locations, (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Inc.},

@article{Alpern2014,
abstract = {Accumulation games on discrete locations were introduced by Ruckle and
Kikuta. The Hider secretly distributes his total wealth h {\textgreater}= 1 over
locations 1,2, ... , n. The Searcher confiscates the material from any r
of these locations. The Hider wins if the wealth remaining at the n - r
unsearched locations sums to at least 1; otherwise the Searcher wins.
Their game models problems in which the Hider needs to have, after
confiscation (or loss by natural causes), a sufficient amount of
material (food, wealth, arms) to carry out some objective (survive the
winter, buy a house, start an insurrection). The conjecture of Kikuta
and Ruckle shows that there is always an optimal Hider strategy which
places equal amounts of material on certain locations (and nothing on
the rest) is still open and known to be hard. This article takes the
hiding locations to be the nodes of a graph and restricts the node sets
which the Searcher can remove to be drawn from a given family: the
edges, the connected r - sets, or some other given sets of nodes. This
models the case where the pilferer, or storm, is known to act only on a
set of close locations. Unlike the original game, our game requires
mixed strategies. We give a complete solution for certain classes of
graphs. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Lin2013,
abstract = {This paper presents a patrol problem, where a patroller traverses a graph through edges to detect potential attacks at nodes. To design a patrol policy, the patroller needs to take into account not only the graph structure, but also the different attack time distributions, as well as different costs incurred due to successful attacks, at different nodes. We consider both random attackers and strategic attackers. A random attacker chooses which node to attack according to a probability distribution known to the patroller. A strategic attacker plays a two-person zero-sum game with the patroller. For each case, we give an exact linear program to compute the optimal solution. Because the linear programs quickly become computationally intractable as the problem size grows, we develop index-based heuristics. In the random-attacker case, our heuristic is optimal when there are two nodes, and in a suitably chosen asymptotic regime. In the strategic-attacker case, our heuristic is optimal when there are two nodes if the attack times are deterministic taking integer values. In our numerical experiments, our heuristic typically achieves within 1{\%} of optimality with computation time orders of magnitude less than what is required to compute the optimal policy.},

@article{Papadaki2016,
abstract = {Patrolling games were recently introduced to model the problem of
protecting the nodes of a network from an attack. Time is discrete and
in each time unit the Patroller can stay at the same node or move to an
adjacent node. The Attacker chooses when to attack and which node to
attack and needs m consecutive time units to carry it out. The Attacker
wins if the Patroller does not visit the chosen node while it is being
attacked; otherwise, the Patroller wins. This paper studies the
patrolling game where the network is a line graph of n nodes, which
models the problem of guarding a channel or protecting a border from
infiltration. We solve the patrolling game for any values of m and n,
providing an optimal Patroller strategy, an optimal Attacker strategy,
and the value of the game (optimal probability that the attack is
intercepted).},

@article{Alpern2011,
abstract = {A key operational problem for those charged with the security of vulnerable facilities (such as airports or art galleries) is the scheduling and deployment of patrols. Motivated by the problem of optimizing randomized, and thus unpredictable, patrols, we present a class of patrolling games. The facility to be patrolled can be thought of as a network or graph Q of interconnected nodes (e.g., rooms, terminals), and the Attacker can choose to attack any node of Q within a given time T. He requires m consecutive periods there, uninterrupted by the Patroller, to commit his nefarious act (and win). The Patroller can follow any path on the graph. Thus, the patrolling game is a win-lose game, where the Value is the probability that the Patroller successfully intercepts an attack, given best play on both sides. We determine analytically either the Value of the game, or bounds on the Value, for various classes of graphs, and we discuss possible extensions and generalizations.},
